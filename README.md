Overview
This repository provides tools and utilities for data extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The goal is to simplify the process of extracting relevant information from unstructured text data, enabling researchers and developers to focus on building and improving NLP models without the hassle of manual data preprocessing.

Features
Text Extraction: Extracts text data from various sources, such as documents, websites, or raw text files.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and extracts named entities, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, etc., from the input text.
Keyword Extraction: Identifies and extracts important keywords or phrases from the text, aiding in content summarization and analysis.
Dependency Parsing: Parses the syntactic structure of sentences to extract relationships between words, providing insights into the grammatical and semantic meaning of the text.
Data Cleaning: Includes utilities for cleaning and preprocessing extracted data, handling common issues like noise, missing values, and irrelevant information.
